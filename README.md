# Introduction
This repository serves the following purposes:

* Server used by Soldat United
* Boilerplate code example to easily create your own server

# Getting started
Working on your own server is possible in a few steps.

* clone the repository to the folder `su-server`.
* Download the latest soldat server from [here](http://soldat.pl/de/downloads/).
* Unpack it into the `su-server` folder. Merge conflicting folders (e.g. maps/ and scripts/) but don't overwrite existing files (like soldat.ini).
* Adjust soldat.ini, scripts/ and more to your liking and start the server with `./soldatserver`

# Contribute
If you want to contribute, there are many roles that can be filled.

* Website developer, designing
* Server maintainer, scripting
* Gather admin
* ...

Pull requests are welcome.

# TODO
There's much left to do.

* Basic script: !help, !p, !up, !r, !maps, !map !random !a !b !c !d !s !ub
* Advanced script: !irc !stats
* More ideas...
